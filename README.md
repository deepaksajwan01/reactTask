## Do the following tasks for characters.component.jsx:

See the comments in characters.component.jsx also

1. clone or fork this [repo](https://github.com/bijay-ps/react-test)

2. When the page loads, Use [this api](https://swapi.dev/api/people/) to fetch all the characters of star wars and display in a tabular format with a custom filter at top using which 
we should be able to filter the characters by name and implement a sorting feature at the table header, so that the data can be sorted either in ascending or descending order.  

3. Once the data is there on the page. Use https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=<SEARCH_TERM> to search for a particular character by their name. Replace <SEARCH_TERM> with the name and make the API call.

4. And once you are done with the changes, push the code to your own github repo and host the same using github pages and share the link with us.
